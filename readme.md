### **mvng - mv next generation!**

A much needed update for the very very very VERY old UNIX mv command, now with **EXTRA FEATURES**
and **USER FRIENDLINESS**

The problem with mv:

1. You want to move a directory recusively to another location.
2. the mv commmand aborts or gets interrupted for whatever reason.
3. You are trying to resume the move and it won't work anymore. Directory not empty is the error, --force gets ignored.

The solution: mvng

Welcome to the 21. century! **;-)**
